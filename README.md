# Password Hashing Lab

A security-focused Python lab that demonstrates why password hashing choices matter.

This project compares **secure vs insecure hashing strategies** and shows how attackers exploit weak designs.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Differences between hashing algorithms
- Importance of salting and slow hashing
- Why fast hashes are dangerous
- Practical threat modeling for password storage

---

## Security Topics Covered

- SHA-256 (insecure for passwords)
- bcrypt
- Argon2
- Salting and peppering
- Brute-force simulation
- Password cracking cost analysis

---

## Core Features

- Implement multiple password storage strategies
- Benchmark cracking speed differences
- Demonstrate rainbow table resistance
- Show why slow hashes protect users
- Clear security explanations

---

## Why This Project Exists

Many systems still store passwords incorrectly.
This lab explains **why that is dangerous** with real examples.

---

## Intended Audience

- Developers
- Security Engineers
- Application Security
- Anyone handling user authentication

---

## Disclaimer

This project does NOT encourage password cracking.
It exists to demonstrate defensive security principles only.
